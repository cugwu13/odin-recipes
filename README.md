# odin-recipes
The Odin Project Recipes HTML project.
## Project Description
This project will consist of a homepage that will have links to a few recipes. The focus of this project is HTML; structuring HTML documents, understanding the different HTML tags and their corresponding attributes goes a long way in web development.

### First Iteration
The project is a simple HTML document that contains bare-bones informatin; an index (homepage) with links to various recipes; recipe pages that list ingredients and steps in order to create the respective meals.

### Second Iteration
CSS was added to this project in order to style and make the HTML pages come alive. Background colors, font sizes, font families, and several other attributes were changed during this iteration. The goal of this iteration was to become more familiar with CSS and the 'cascade' aspect of CSS.
