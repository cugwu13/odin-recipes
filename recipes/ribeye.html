        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Why go to a steakhouse when you can make the most perfect ribeye right at home? Pan seared with the best garlicky herb butter!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (24-ounce) bone-in ribeye steak, 2-inch-thick, at room temperature</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.</li>
            <li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
